I'm a passionate researcher and software developer with a background in computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, and financial analytics. My journey began with a BSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering, followed by an MSc in Computer Engineering at Addis Ababa University. My MSc research focused on reconstructing Proto-Words for Ethiopian Semitic languages using deep learning models, including LSTM, Transformer, and GRU-based encoder-decoder architectures. I have also worked on predictive analytics for financial forecasting and sentiment analysis. Beyond research, I work in front-end web development and integrating AI into real-world applications.
 
I approach both my work and personal life with curiosity, determination, and a strong appreciation for meaningful connections. Whether I am analyzing data or thinking about human relationships, I value clear communication, honesty, and continuous learning. 

## News 

I finished my MSc on computer Engineering from AAiT! 

Our paper on [Cognate Detection for Historical Language Reconstruction of Proto-Sabean Languages: the Case of Geâ€™ez, Tigrinya, and Amharic](https://hhnigatu.github.io//publication/2024-zenos-emnlp) was accepted and published on COLING 2025.
