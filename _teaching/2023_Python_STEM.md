As a Python Instructor, I had helped design and deliver comprehensive Python programming courses tailored to students of varying skill levels. I had developed structured lesson plans, hands-on exercises, and real-world projects to enhance learning outcomes. My role involved mentoring students, providing one-on-one support, and assessing their progress to ensure a solid understanding of key programming concepts. I had taught both fundamental and advanced topics, including Python for beginners, object-oriented programming (OOP), and data structures.
