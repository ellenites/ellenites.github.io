As a Python Instructor, I delivered courses for students at varying skill levels, covering core programming concepts and applications of large language models via APIs. As a team we developed lesson plans and hands-on exercises, while mentoring students, providing one-on-one support, and assessing their progress to ensure strong learning outcomes.
